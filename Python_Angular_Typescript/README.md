ðŸš€Deep Dive Session (Python, Angular, TypeScript)ðŸš€
Welcome to the Deep Dive Session focused on Python, Angular, and TypeScript. This session is designed to help you learn and leverage the features of GitHub Copilot through hands-on exercises and challenges.

Pre-requisites
VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA
Python 3.10.1
Angular 17: Node 18, 20, 22
GitHub Copilot Extension configured and working in your IDE
Postman/Bruno
For Linux/VDI: Install PROXY CNTLM

Session Structure
The session is divided into two main parts:

Part 1: Exercise
In this part, you will work on a series of guided exercises to familiarize yourself with the basics of GitHub Copilot and how it can assist in writing boilerplate code for Python, Angular, and TypeScript applications.

Key Learning Objectives:
Understand how to use GitHub Copilot for code suggestions.
Learn to create REST APIs using FastAPI.
Explore Angular components and services.
Practice TypeScript basics and advanced features.
Tasks:
Hello Copilot: Create a simple REST endpoint using FastAPI.
Days Between Dates: Implement a REST API to calculate the number of days between two dates.
Documentation: Add Docs and generate interactive API documentation using Swagger.
Error Handling: Set up a global error handling mechanism in FastAPI.
Code Optimization: Refactor and optimize code using GitHub Copilot's context-aware suggestions.
Part 2: Challenge
In this part, you will apply the skills learned in the exercises to solve a more complex challenge. The challenge involves building a complete application with both back-end and front-end components.

Key Learning Objectives:
Build a RESTful API using FastAPI.
Create a user interface with Angular.
Integrate the front-end and back-end.
Implement advanced features like error handling, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.
Challenge Tasks:
Back-end Development:

Build a complete RESTful API for managing movies.
Implement CRUD operations, tests and error handling.
Optimize the code and ensure security.
Front-end Development:

Create a user interface for interacting with the API.
Implement forms for adding, editing, and deleting movies with tests.
Ensure responsive design and user-friendly experience.
Extra challenge:

Write and run tests to ensure the application works correctly.
Optionally, add advanced features like search, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.
Conclusion
By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of how to use GitHub Copilot to enhance your development workflow in Python, Angular, and TypeScript. You will also have hands-on experience building and optimizing a full-stack application.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
