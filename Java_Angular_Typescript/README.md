# ðŸš€Deep Dive Session (Java, Angular, TypeScript)ðŸš€

Welcome to the Deep Dive Session focused on Java, Angular, and TypeScript. This session is designed to help you learn and leverage the features of GitHub Copilot through hands-on exercises and challenges.

## Pre-requisites

- VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA
- JDK 17
- Maven 3.9
- Angular 17: Node 18, 20, 22
- GitHub Copilot Extension configured and working in your IDE
- Postman/Bruno

**For Linux/VDI: Install PROXY CNTLM**

## Session Structure

The session is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Exercise

In this part, you will work on a series of guided exercises to familiarize yourself with the basics of GitHub Copilot and how it can assist in writing boilerplate code for Java, Angular, and TypeScript applications.

#### Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand how to use GitHub Copilot for code suggestions.
- Learn to create REST APIs using Spring Boot.
- Explore Angular components and services.
- Practice TypeScript basics and advanced features.

#### Tasks:
1. **Hello Copilot**: Create a simple REST endpoint using Spring Boot.
2. **Days Between Dates**: Implement a REST API to calculate the number of days between two dates.
3. **Documentation**: Add JavaDocs and generate interactive API documentation using Swagger.
4. **Error Handling**: Set up a global error handling mechanism in Spring Boot.
5. **Code Optimization**: Refactor and optimize code using GitHub Copilot's context-aware suggestions.

### Part 2: Challenge

In this part, you will apply the skills learned in the exercises to solve a more complex challenge. The challenge involves building a complete application with both back-end and front-end components.

#### Key Learning Objectives:
- Build a RESTful API using Spring Boot.
- Create a user interface with Angular.
- Integrate the front-end and back-end.
- Implement advanced features like error handling, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Challenge Tasks:
1. **Back-end Development**: 
   - Build a complete RESTful API for managing movies.
   - Implement CRUD operations, tests and error handling.
   - Optimize the code and ensure security.

2. **Front-end Development**: 
   - Create a user interface for interacting with the API.
   - Implement forms for adding, editing, and deleting movies with tests.
   - Ensure responsive design and user-friendly experience.

3. **Integration and Testing**: 
   - Write and run tests to ensure the application works correctly.
   - Optionally, add advanced features like search, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of how to use GitHub Copilot to enhance your development workflow in Java, Angular, and TypeScript. You will also have hands-on experience building and optimizing a full-stack application.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
